# Polyglot-Voice-Translate-Read-and-Visualize-Text
Polyglot Voice is a web-based application that enables users to translate text into multiple languages, listen to translations with natural text-to-speech, and visualize content with a word cloud. Built with Python, Streamlit, and NLP libraries, it bridges the gap between languages by combining translation, speech, and visualization in one tool.
